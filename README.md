Professionals.ng
Online businesses and marketing has in time past placed emphasis on the sale of products at the detriment of the sale of services. However, in recent times, due to increased use of the internet and social networking sites the scale has been tipped in the favour of sales of services. Professionals.ng is website that enables people to search for professional services by name of the professional, type of service, location e.t.c. Professionals on the other hand are able to rent virtual offices that are open and accessible 24/7 which is far better than running adverts on social media platforms which can only be shown periodically.
Users
There are two users for this system; those in search of professional service and those who render professional service. Those in search of professional services can search for services either by service type, location or the name of a professional who performs the service. They are also able to recommend professionals who have done jobs to their satisfaction, however, to this, they must have an account with Professionals.ng. Those who offer professional services are able to rent virtual offices that are open and accessible 24/7.
